# Farming Simulation: Carrot Farming with Rabbits and Dogs

## University Project

This project simulates a farming environment where farmers grow carrots on a field of size NxN. The farmers move randomly and plant carrots if they are not already planted. The carrots grow over several rounds, but the field is subject to challenges, such as rabbits appearing and damaging the crops. Fortunately, each farmer is assisted by a dog that helps eliminate the rabbits. The dog moves randomly or in response to signals from the farmer and detects rabbits within a range of 5 tiles.

### Features

- **Carrot Planting**: Farmers plant carrots on the field, ensuring that no spot is left without crops.
- **Carrot Growth**: Carrots grow over several rounds, requiring periodic attention from farmers.
- **Rabbit Attacks**: Rabbits appear randomly and eat carrots, damaging the crops.
- **Dog Assistance**: The dog detects rabbits and moves towards them to eliminate them, ensuring crop protection.
- **Field Repair**: After rabbits damage the crops, farmers must repair the land and replant carrots, which consumes time.
- **Random Movement**: Both farmers and dogs move randomly across the field, but the dog follows specific behavior patterns when detecting rabbits.
